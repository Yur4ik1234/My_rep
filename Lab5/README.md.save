1. In the file `requirements.txt` we have installed packeges.

2. I used next commands: `pipenv --python 3.8`,
`pipenv install -r requirements.txt`,`pipenv run python app.py`
The last command didn't work because Redis was not installed on my machine

3. I used command `sudo apt install redis-server` to install Redice and 
`sudo nano /etc/redis/redis.conf` to set supervised dirictive to `systemd`
And after that my site started working.

4. Used command `pipenv run pytest test_app.py --url http://localhost:5000`
to test all pages. Firstly it did not work, but after I vreated logs dir 
it started working. All 4 tests passed
